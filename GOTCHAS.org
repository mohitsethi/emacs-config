Flymake has a lot of tiny things we need to be aware of:
** For each of the checkers files (in subfolders in plugins/):
   - make the file executable and put it somewhere in the path (eg: /usr/bin) so that the system can find it.
** For c projects, create a makefile and add the following in it:
#+BEGIN_SRC makefile
  check-syntax:
       gcc -o nul -S ${CHK_SOURCES}
#+END_SRC

* Python
install python and python-pip on the system:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo aptitude install python python-pip
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo pip install pyflakes pep8

Follow the instructions in plugins/python-emacs/README.org to setup python
