-*- mode: org -*-
This folder contains my emacs configuration. In order to install this emacs configuration correctly, the following steps need to be observed:

* Clone the emacs configuration repository

* Install the submodules

git submodule init
git submodule update

I use org as a submodule. Org-configuration will fail to load without org's repository.

* Go through the GOTCHAS file.


We are now ready to roll with my configuration. Restart emacs and enjoy.
