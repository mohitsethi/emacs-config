-*- mode: org -*-
This folder contains my emacs configuration. In order to install this emacs configuration correctly, the following steps need to be observed:

* Clone the emacs configuration repository

* Open the file configuration/mode-config.el and comment out the following lines:

(require 'org-install)
(require 'org-mode-config)
(org-agenda-to-appt)

This is because I use org as a submodule. Org-configuration will fail to load without my org files and before you pull from org's repository.

* Install the submodules

git submodule init
git submodule update

* Undo the change we made in the configuration.

* Go through the GOTCHAS file.


We are now ready to roll with my configuration. Restart emacs and enjoy.
