This folder contains my emacs configuration. In order to install this emacs configuration correctly, the following steps need to be observed:

1. Clone the emacs configuration repository

2. Open the file configuration/mode-config.el and comment out the following lines:

(require 'org-install)
(require 'org-mode-config)
(org-agenda-to-appt)

This is because I use org as a submodule. Org-configuration will fail to load without my org files and before you pull from org's repository.

3. Install the submodules

git submodule init
git submodule update

5. Undo the change we made in the configuration.


We are now ready to roll with my configuration. Restart emacs and enjoy.
