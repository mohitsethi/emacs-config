This folder contains my emacs configuration. In order to install this emacs configuration correctly, the following steps need to be observed:

* Clone the emacs configuration repository

  - git clone --recursive git://github.com/vedang/emacs-config.git .emacs.d

* Go through the following files:

 - plugins/clojure-emacs/README.org
 - plugins/python-emacs/README.org
 - plugins/cscope-emacs/README.org
 - PREREQUISITES.org

We are now ready to roll with my configuration. Restart emacs and enjoy.

* Note:

This configuration will only work with Emacs 24. It has been stable in my testing, but please open an issue if you have any trouble using it.
