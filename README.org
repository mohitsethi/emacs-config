This folder contains my emacs configuration. In order to install this emacs configuration correctly, the following steps need to be observed:

* Clone the emacs configuration repository

* Install the submodules
  - git submodule init
  - git submodule update

* Go through the GOTCHAS file.

We are now ready to roll with my configuration. Restart emacs and enjoy.

* Note:

I am currently transitioning my emacs configuration from Emacs 23 to Emacs 24. I cannot guarantee the stability of this configuration.
