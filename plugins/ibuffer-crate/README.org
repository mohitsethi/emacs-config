This folder contains some extra configuration over ibuffer which is
the bee's knees. You can choose to use this standalone by dropping
this folder anywhere in your .emacs.d and adding the following to your
init.el:

   (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ibuffer-crate")
   (require 'ibuffer-crate-init)
